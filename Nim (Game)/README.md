# NIM Game
_Nim_ is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects less than a fixed number. The last one to play wins the game.

### Steps to run the Game

 - Open a terminal in the folder containing the nim.cpp file.
 - Type "sudo apt install g++" (This step is optional if you already have c++ compiler).
 - Type "g++ nim.cpp".
 - Type " ./a.out ".
 - Enjoy!!!
